TODO
====

- complex case is not handled yet by **compile_symbol** (must check if the expression is complex using sympy)

- second derivatives

- block tests are ok when created using Curl, Div, etc => glt/test_1d_block_1 is not working

- for the moment, operators *dx*, *dy* and *dz* are not modified by *gelatize* function.

- mapping

- coordinates system

- make the degree a free symbol in mass, stiffness, advection glt symbols
